# ue4-resembleai-api

It creates human-like voice clips for the text data using Resemble AI Technology API. This solution is based on the Blueprint widget utility of UE4 and has three modes of operation:

- You add the whole raw speech data for any take in normal mode.
- In advance mode, you add SSML tags to generate human-like expressive voices. The abbreviation of the SSML tag is the Speech Synthesis Markup Language tag for those who arenâ€™t familiar with it.
- You either modify the part of the whole speech text or validate/delete the SSML tags.
